# LLM Applications

[Chinese version](README_ch.md)

## 1. API key

If you want to use business-level LLMs, such as GPT, and pay by usage rather than subscription, API key is a good option.

The original OpenAI and other organizations' API keys still don't work from restricted countries and regions.

To overcome the restriction, we can get API keys from API providers, such as [AiHubMix](https://aihubmix.com/), [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) and etc.

## 2. VPN

If you want to directly use the GPT official web, you need a VPN to bypass the restriction.

Subscribe from VPN provider such as [GHelper](https://ghelper.net/). Turn on VPN and visit the websites.

## 3. Ollama

[Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama) is a tool to run LLMs locally (support Windows, Linux and Mac)

## 4. Perplexica

[Perplexica](https://github.com/ItzCrazyKns/Perplexica) is a tool to use LLM during web search. Support Ollama models and API keys in OpenAI format.

## 5. GitHub Copilot
