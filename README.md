# How to use LLMs & LLM Applications

[中文版](README_ch.md)

## 1. API Key

If you want to use enterprise-grade LLMs, like GPT, and prefer paying based on usage rather than a subscription, obtaining an API key is a great option.

However, the original API keys from OpenAI and other providers may not work in restricted countries or regions.

To bypass these restrictions, you can obtain API keys from third-party providers such as [AiHubMix](https://aihubmix.com/) and [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/).

## 2. VPN

To access the official GPT website directly, you'll need a VPN to bypass regional restrictions.

Consider subscribing to a VPN service like [GHelper](https://ghelper.net/). Activate the VPN and visit the desired websites.

## 3. Ollama

[Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama) is a tool that allows you to run LLMs locally on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

## 4. Perplexica

[Perplexica](https://github.com/ItzCrazyKns/Perplexica) is a tool designed to integrate LLMs into web searches. It supports both Ollama models and API keys in OpenAI's format.

## 5. GitHub Copilot

GitHub Copilot is a tool that assists developers with coding. For more details, visit the [GitHub Copilot page](https://github.com/features/copilot).
